<p>The Copy as FFUF Burp Suite extension adds new context menu entries that can be used to build a skeleton for ffuf web fuzzer</p>

<p>The extension offers the following copy methods in the context menu of selected messages:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Copy as FFUF</li>
</ul>

<b>Known issue</b>: As a workaround for an issue in virtual machines, if the method with the selected response data is chosen, you have to wait 1.5 seconds before you can paste the copied text. thx #CompassSecurity
